# Turnover notch positions

Content from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_rotor_details#Turnover_notch_positions).

The single turnover notch positioned on the left side (plate connector side) of the rotor triggers the stepping motion by engaging the ratchet teeth of the wheel to the left. Later rotors had two turnover notches. The table below lists the turnover notch point of each rotor.

| Rotor | Notch | Effect |
| I 	  | Q 	  | If rotor steps from Q to R, the next rotor is advanced |
| II 	  | E 	  | If rotor steps from E to F, the next rotor is advanced |
| III 	| V 	  | If rotor steps from V to W, the next rotor is advanced |
| IV 	  | J 	  | If rotor steps from J to K, the next rotor is advanced |
| V 	  | Z 	  | If rotor steps from Z to A, the next rotor is advanced |
| VI, VII, VIII |	Z+M |	If rotor steps from Z to A, or from M to N the next rotor is advanced |

## Normalized Enigma sequences

In the following examples you can observe a normal step sequence and a double step sequence. The used rotors are (from left to right) I, II, III, with turnovers on Q, E and V. It is the right rotor's behavior we observe here (turnover V).

### Normal sequence

- AAU — normal step of right rotor
- AAV — right rotor (III) goes in V—notch position
- ABW — right rotor takes middle rotor one step further
- ABX — normal step of right rotor

### Double step sequence

- ADU — normal step of right rotor
- ADV — right rotor (III) goes in V—notch position
- AEW — right rotor steps, takes middle rotor (II) one step further, which is now in its own E—notch position
- BFX — normal step of right rotor, double step of middle rotor, normal step of left rotor
- BFY — normal step of right rotor
